# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive Docusaurus documentation website for the Kiro Communication Bridge REST API. The documentation website will serve as the primary reference for Flutter frontend developers and other clients integrating with the bridge's REST interface. The website must provide clear, accurate, and complete documentation of all API endpoints, data structures, error handling, and integration patterns.

2. WHEN I navigate to the API reference section THEN I SHALL find detailed documentation for all REST endpoints
3. WHEN I view an endpoint documentation THEN I SHALL see request/response schemas, examples, and error codes
4. WHEN I need to understand data structures THEN I SHALL find complete type definitions and interfaces
5. WHEN I encounter errors THEN I SHALL find detailed error handling documentation with recovery strategies

### Requirement 2

2. WHEN I want to understand data flow THEN I SHALL see sequence diagrams for key operations
3. WHEN I need deployment information THEN I SHALL find configuration and setup instructions
4. WHEN I want to understand scalability THEN I SHALL find performance characteristics and limitations
5. WHEN I need troubleshooting guidance THEN I SHALL find common issues and solutions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new developer on the project, I want getting started guides so that I can quickly set up and begin using the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I first visit the documentation THEN I SHALL find a clear getting started guide
2. WHEN I need to set up the bridge THEN I SHALL find step-by-step installation instructions
3. WHEN I want to make my first API call THEN I SHALL find a quick start tutorial
4. WHEN I need development environment setup THEN I SHALL find configuration examples
5. WHEN I encounter setup issues THEN I SHALL find troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the documentation, I want the site to be automatically generated from code so that it stays accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN the documentation SHALL reflect those changes automatically
2. WHEN new endpoints are added THEN they SHALL appear in the documentation
3. WHEN type definitions change THEN the schema documentation SHALL update accordingly
4. WHEN examples are modified THEN the documentation SHALL show the latest versions
5. WHEN the site is built THEN it SHALL validate against the actual API implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user of the documentation website, I want excellent navigation and search capabilities so that I can quickly find the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to find specific information THEN I SHALL have access to full-text search
2. WHEN I browse the documentation THEN I SHALL see a clear navigation structure
3. WHEN I view a page THEN I SHALL see a table of contents for easy navigation
4. WHEN I need related information THEN I SHALL find cross-references and links
5. WHEN I want to bookmark content THEN I SHALL have stable URLs for all sections

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want the documentation to be responsive and accessible so that I can use it on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria
