# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Kiro Orchestration Extension is a critical component of the Household Software Engineer system that enables seamless communication between the Flutter frontend dashboard and the Kiro IDE. This extension transforms Kiro into a headless development environment that can automatically create, develop, and manage user applications based on natural language requests from the frontend.

The extension serves as the bridge between user intent (expressed through the Flutter UI) and automated development execution (performed by Kiro IDE), enabling non-technical users to create custom applications through conversational interfaces while maintaining full development lifecycle management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend service, I want to send application creation requests to the Kiro extension, so that I can initiate automated development of user-requested applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension receives an HTTP POST request to `/api/applications/create` THEN it SHALL validate the request payload and respond with a job ID
2. WHEN the request payload contains a valid `description` field THEN the extension SHALL create a new application directory in the `apps/` folder
3. WHEN the request payload contains an optional `conversationId` field THEN the extension SHALL associate the job with the existing conversation context
4. IF the request payload is malformed or missing required fields THEN the extension SHALL return a 400 error with detailed validation messages
5. WHEN a new application directory is created THEN the extension SHALL generate a unique application ID and create the directory structure `apps/{app-id}/`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend service, I want to receive real-time progress updates during application development, so that I can display meaningful progress information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application development job starts THEN the extension SHALL establish a WebSocket connection and emit a `job-started` event
2. WHEN Kiro executes development commands THEN the extension SHALL capture command outputs and emit `progress-update` events with percentage completion
3. WHEN development phases change (requirements, design, implementation, testing) THEN the extension SHALL emit `phase-changed` events with phase names and descriptions
4. WHEN errors occur during development THEN the extension SHALL emit `error` events with error details and recovery suggestions
5. WHEN an application is successfully completed THEN the extension SHALL emit a `job-completed` event with application metadata

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Kiro IDE user, I want the extension to automatically manage application workspaces, so that each user application is developed in isolation without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new application job starts THEN the extension SHALL create a dedicated workspace folder in `apps/{app-id}/`
2. WHEN setting up the workspace THEN the extension SHALL copy a default spec template that provides Kiro with project context and coding standards
3. WHEN Kiro commands are executed THEN the extension SHALL ensure all file operations are scoped to the application's workspace directory
4. WHEN multiple applications are being developed simultaneously THEN the extension SHALL manage separate Kiro sessions for each application
5. WHEN an application workspace is created THEN the extension SHALL initialize a Git repository with an initial commit

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend service, I want to query application status and metadata, so that I can display current application states in the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension receives a GET request to `/api/applications` THEN it SHALL return a list of all applications with their current status
2. WHEN the extension receives a GET request to `/api/applications/{app-id}` THEN it SHALL return detailed information about the specific application
3. WHEN application metadata is requested THEN the extension SHALL read from the application's `metadata.json` file and return current status, progress, and configuration
4. WHEN an application's metadata file doesn't exist THEN the extension SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate error message
5. WHEN the apps directory doesn't exist THEN the extension SHALL create it and return an empty applications list

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Kiro IDE, I want the extension to provide structured specifications and context, so that I can develop applications according to established patterns and quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new application workspace is created THEN the extension SHALL copy a default spec template to the workspace root
2. WHEN the spec template is copied THEN it SHALL include coding standards, architecture patterns, and quality requirements specific to the application type
3. WHEN Kiro requests project context THEN the extension SHALL provide access to the spec files and any additional context documents
4. WHEN the user's natural language description is processed THEN the extension SHALL generate initial requirements and design documents in the workspace
5. WHEN spec documents are created THEN they SHALL follow the established spec-driven development methodology with requirements, design, and tasks sections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a frontend service, I want to handle user interaction requests from Kiro, so that I can collect additional information needed for application development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro requires additional user input during development THEN the extension SHALL pause the development process and emit a `user-input-required` event
2. WHEN user input is required THEN the extension SHALL include the question, context, and expected response format in the event payload
3. WHEN the frontend provides user input via POST to `/api/applications/{app-id}/input` THEN the extension SHALL validate the input and resume development
4. WHEN user input is invalid or incomplete THEN the extension SHALL return validation errors and maintain the paused state
5. WHEN user input is successfully provided THEN the extension SHALL pass the input to Kiro and emit a `development-resumed` event

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the extension to manage application lifecycle and cleanup, so that the system remains stable and resources are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application development job fails THEN the extension SHALL update the application status to 'failed' and preserve logs for debugging
2. WHEN an application is successfully completed THEN the extension SHALL update the status to 'ready' and create final deployment metadata
3. WHEN the extension starts up THEN it SHALL scan the apps directory and restore the status of any in-progress applications
4. WHEN a development job exceeds the maximum timeout (30 minutes) THEN the extension SHALL terminate the job and mark it as failed
5. WHEN cleanup is requested THEN the extension SHALL provide endpoints to remove failed or unwanted applications and their associated files

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a frontend service, I want to control application development lifecycle, so that I can start, pause, resume, and cancel development jobs as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension receives a POST request to `/api/applications/{app-id}/pause` THEN it SHALL pause the current development process and emit a `job-paused` event
2. WHEN the extension receives a POST request to `/api/applications/{app-id}/resume` THEN it SHALL resume the paused development process and emit a `job-resumed` event
3. WHEN the extension receives a POST request to `/api/applications/{app-id}/cancel` THEN it SHALL terminate the development process and mark the application as cancelled
4. WHEN a job is paused THEN the extension SHALL preserve the current state and allow resumption from the same point
5. WHEN a job is cancelled THEN the extension SHALL clean up temporary resources while preserving the workspace for potential future restart

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to provide comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API request is received THEN the extension SHALL log the request details, timestamp, and response status
2. WHEN Kiro commands are executed THEN the extension SHALL log command inputs, outputs, and execution times
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the extension SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces and context
4. WHEN development jobs are processed THEN the extension SHALL maintain job logs that can be retrieved via `/api/applications/{app-id}/logs`
5. WHEN the extension starts THEN it SHALL log the startup process, configuration, and any initialization errors

### Requirement 10
