# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Application Orchestrator is the central coordination service that manages the complete lifecycle of user-requested applications within the Household Software Engineer system. It serves as the intelligent middleware between the Flutter frontend and Amazon Kiro, handling natural language processing, specification generation, development job management, progress monitoring, and deployment coordination. The orchestrator ensures seamless user experience while maintaining robust error handling, resource management, and application quality standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a household user, I want my natural language application requests to be intelligently processed and converted into actionable development specifications, so that I can create applications without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a natural language application request THEN the orchestrator SHALL parse and analyze the request for completeness and clarity
2. WHEN the request is ambiguous or incomplete THEN the orchestrator SHALL generate clarifying questions and manage the conversation flow
3. WHEN sufficient information is gathered THEN the orchestrator SHALL generate a structured technical specification suitable for Kiro development
4. WHEN the specification is complete THEN the orchestrator SHALL validate it against system capabilities and resource constraints
5. IF the request exceeds system limitations THEN the orchestrator SHALL suggest alternative approaches or simplified versions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the orchestrator to manage Amazon Kiro development sessions automatically, so that applications are developed consistently and reliably without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a validated specification is ready THEN the orchestrator SHALL create a new headless Kiro development session with appropriate configuration
2. WHEN a Kiro session is active THEN the orchestrator SHALL monitor progress, collect logs, and track milestone completion
3. WHEN development milestones are reached THEN the orchestrator SHALL update application status and notify the frontend in real-time
4. WHEN code generation is complete THEN the orchestrator SHALL collect all artifacts and validate them against quality standards
5. IF a Kiro session fails or stalls THEN the orchestrator SHALL attempt recovery procedures and escalate persistent failures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to see real-time progress updates during application development, so that I understand what's happening and when my application will be ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development begins THEN the orchestrator SHALL establish WebSocket connections with the frontend for real-time updates
2. WHEN development progress occurs THEN the orchestrator SHALL broadcast progress updates including percentage completion and current phase
3. WHEN significant milestones are reached THEN the orchestrator SHALL send detailed status updates with human-readable descriptions
4. WHEN build logs are generated THEN the orchestrator SHALL stream relevant log entries to the frontend with appropriate filtering
5. WHEN development completes or fails THEN the orchestrator SHALL send final status notifications with next steps or error resolution guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the orchestrator to manage application deployment automatically, so that completed applications are immediately available for use without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro development completes successfully THEN the orchestrator SHALL automatically initiate the deployment process
2. WHEN deploying an application THEN the orchestrator SHALL create appropriate container configurations and security policies
3. WHEN containers are created THEN the orchestrator SHALL register the application with the reverse proxy and configure routing
4. WHEN deployment is complete THEN the orchestrator SHALL perform health checks and verify application accessibility
5. IF deployment fails THEN the orchestrator SHALL rollback changes, preserve artifacts, and provide detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to modify existing applications through conversation, so that I can iteratively improve my tools as my needs evolve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests application modifications THEN the orchestrator SHALL load existing application context and specifications
2. WHEN processing modification requests THEN the orchestrator SHALL analyze the impact on existing functionality and data
3. WHEN modifications are feasible THEN the orchestrator SHALL generate an updated specification preserving compatible features
4. WHEN modifications require breaking changes THEN the orchestrator SHALL warn the user and suggest migration strategies
5. WHEN modification development completes THEN the orchestrator SHALL deploy the updated application while preserving user data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the orchestrator to manage system resources efficiently, so that multiple applications can be developed and deployed without resource conflicts or system instability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple development requests are received THEN the orchestrator SHALL queue jobs and manage concurrent execution based on available resources
2. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the orchestrator SHALL prioritize jobs based on user preferences and system policies
3. WHEN applications are deployed THEN the orchestrator SHALL enforce resource limits and monitor usage to prevent system overload
4. WHEN resource thresholds are exceeded THEN the orchestrator SHALL throttle new requests and notify users of delays
5. WHEN applications are no longer needed THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide cleanup mechanisms to reclaim system resources

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the orchestrator to enforce security policies and data privacy, so that my household information remains protected and applications operate safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating applications THEN the orchestrator SHALL enforce security policies for network access, file system permissions, and system integration
2. WHEN applications are deployed THEN the orchestrator SHALL apply appropriate sandboxing and isolation measures
3. WHEN handling user data THEN the orchestrator SHALL ensure all processing remains local and no sensitive information is transmitted externally
4. WHEN applications request elevated permissions THEN the orchestrator SHALL require explicit user approval and provide clear explanations
5. IF security violations are detected THEN the orchestrator SHALL immediately halt operations and alert the user with remediation steps

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling throughout the orchestration process, so that issues can be quickly diagnosed and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any orchestration operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information with correlation IDs for request tracing
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the orchestrator SHALL capture full context, stack traces, and system state for debugging
3. WHEN user-facing errors happen THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages without exposing technical details
4. WHEN system health degrades THEN the orchestrator SHALL detect issues early and attempt automatic recovery procedures
5. WHEN persistent problems occur THEN the orchestrator SHALL escalate to appropriate monitoring systems and provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a household user, I want the orchestrator to learn from my preferences and usage patterns, so that future application suggestions and development become more personalized and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with the system THEN the orchestrator SHALL track preferences, common patterns, and successful application types
2. WHEN processing new requests THEN the orchestrator SHALL suggest improvements based on previous successful applications
3. WHEN generating specifications THEN the orchestrator SHALL incorporate learned patterns to reduce development time and improve quality
4. WHEN users provide feedback THEN the orchestrator SHALL incorporate ratings and comments to improve future recommendations
5. WHEN usage patterns emerge THEN the orchestrator SHALL proactively suggest related applications or enhancements that might be useful
