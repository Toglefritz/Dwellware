# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Household Software Engineer is a desktop system that enables non-technical users to create, deploy, and manage custom household applications through a conversational interface. The system consists of a Flutter desktop frontend, an orchestrator backend, AI-powered development capabilities via Amazon Kiro, and containerized application isolation. All processing and execution remains local for privacy and control, with each generated application running independently in sandboxed environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to request new custom applications through a friendly interface, so that I can create bespoke software tools without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a grid/tile view of existing applications
2. WHEN a user clicks "Request New Application" THEN the system SHALL present a conversational interface for describing the desired application
3. WHEN a user provides an application description THEN the system SHALL convert the input into a structured specification document
4. WHEN the specification is created THEN the system SHALL initiate a development session in Amazon Kiro
5. IF the user input is unclear or incomplete THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions before proceeding

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to see real-time progress of application development, so that I understand what's happening and when my app will be ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application development session starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator on the dashboard
2. WHEN development milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL update the progress display with high-level status information
3. WHEN build or test failures occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate status messages without overwhelming technical details
4. WHEN an application is successfully built THEN the system SHALL notify the user and make the app available for launch

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to launch and use my custom applications seamlessly, so that I can accomplish my household management tasks efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a completed application tile THEN the system SHALL launch the application in an appropriate container (WebView for web apps, native window for desktop apps)
2. WHEN an application is launched THEN the system SHALL ensure it runs in a sandboxed environment with restricted network and filesystem access
3. WHEN multiple applications are running THEN each SHALL operate independently without affecting others
4. IF an application fails to launch THEN the system SHALL display an error message and offer troubleshooting options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to modify existing applications through conversation, so that I can iteratively improve my tools as my needs change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an existing application THEN the system SHALL provide an option to "Request Modifications"
2. WHEN a user describes desired changes THEN the system SHALL create an updated specification and initiate a development session
3. WHEN modifications are complete THEN the system SHALL update the existing application without breaking its data or configuration
4. IF modifications conflict with existing functionality THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all applications to be properly isolated and managed, so that the system remains stable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated App Capsule containing source code, tests, manifest, and container configuration
2. WHEN an application runs THEN the system SHALL enforce network and filesystem access restrictions via per-app policies
3. WHEN an application needs data storage THEN the system SHALL provide isolated local storage that doesn't interfere with other applications
4. WHEN an application requires secrets THEN the system SHALL integrate with macOS Keychain for secure credential storage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the orchestrator backend to manage all development and deployment processes automatically, so that users don't need to handle technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a development job is initiated THEN the orchestrator SHALL manage the headless Amazon Kiro development session
2. WHEN applications are built THEN the orchestrator SHALL deploy them in sandboxed containers
3. WHEN applications are deployed THEN the orchestrator SHALL register them with a local reverse proxy for proper routing
4. WHEN application metadata changes THEN the orchestrator SHALL store updates as JSON documents in the local metadata directory
5. IF any automated process fails THEN the orchestrator SHALL log errors and attempt recovery procedures

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want all processing and data to remain on my local machine, so that my household information stays private and under my control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system operation occurs THEN all processing SHALL happen locally on the user's macOS machine
2. WHEN applications are developed THEN the AI development engine SHALL run locally without sending code or data to external services
3. WHEN applications store data THEN all data SHALL remain on the local filesystem
4. WHEN applications communicate THEN network traffic SHALL be restricted to necessary local services only
5. IF external network access is required for an application THEN the system SHALL explicitly request user permission

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want generated applications to follow consistent patterns and be easily maintainable, so that the system can evolve and scale effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applications are generated THEN they SHALL follow predefined templates and coding policies
2. WHEN applications are built THEN they SHALL include comprehensive tests that validate functionality
3. WHEN applications are deployed THEN they SHALL include proper documentation and manifest files
4. WHEN the AI development engine creates code THEN it SHALL iteratively refine the implementation until all tests pass
5. IF generated code doesn't meet quality standards THEN the system SHALL continue development iterations until requirements are satisfied
