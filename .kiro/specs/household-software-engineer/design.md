# Design Document

## Overview

The Household Software Engineer system is architected as a multi-component desktop application that enables non-technical users to create custom household applications through natural language interaction. The system maintains strict local operation for privacy while providing enterprise-grade application isolation and management capabilities.

The architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation of concerns:
- **Presentation Layer**: Flutter desktop application providing the user interface
- **Orchestration Layer**: Backend service managing application lifecycle and AI development sessions
- **Development Layer**: Amazon Kiro integration for AI-powered code generation
- **Runtime Layer**: Containerized application execution with sandboxing and proxy routing

## Data Models

### Application Metadata

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "status": "enum[requested, developing, testing, deployed, failed]",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp",

  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### User-Facing Error Management

**Graceful Degradation**: When development sessions fail, the system provides clear, non-technical error messages and suggests alternative approaches or simplifications.

**Recovery Mechanisms**: Failed applications can be retried with modified specifications, and partial progress is preserved to avoid starting from scratch.

**Validation Gates**: User input is validated at multiple stages to catch issues early before expensive development operations begin.

### System-Level Error Handling

**Container Failures**: Applications that crash or become unresponsive are automatically restarted with exponential backoff, and persistent failures trigger user notifications.

**Development Session Failures**: Amazon Kiro session interruptions are detected and automatically resumed where possible, with fallback to manual intervention prompts.

**Resource Management**: System monitors disk space, memory usage, and container limits to prevent resource exhaustion and provide early warnings.

### Logging and Monitoring

**Structured Logging**: All components use structured JSON logging with correlation IDs for tracing requests across system boundaries.

**Health Checks**: Each component exposes health endpoints for monitoring system status and detecting degraded performance.

**Audit Trail**: All user actions and system operations are logged for troubleshooting and system analysis.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

**Component Isolation**: Each system component has comprehensive unit tests with mocked dependencies to ensure reliable behavior in isolation.

**Business Logic Validation**: Core algorithms for specification parsing, job management, and application deployment are thoroughly tested with edge cases.

**Error Path Testing**: All error handling paths are explicitly tested to ensure graceful failure modes.

### Integration Testing

**API Contract Testing**: All interfaces between components are validated with contract tests to ensure compatibility during development.

**End-to-End Workflows**: Complete user journeys from application request to deployment are tested in automated scenarios.

**Container Integration**: Application deployment and runtime behavior is tested in realistic container environments.

### User Acceptance Testing

**Usability Validation**: The conversational interface and dashboard are tested with representative household users to ensure intuitive operation.

**Performance Testing**: System responsiveness and resource usage are validated under typical household workloads.

**Security Testing**: Application isolation, network restrictions, and data privacy controls are verified through penetration testing.

### Generated Application Testing

**Template Validation**: All application templates include comprehensive test suites that validate generated code functionality.

**Quality Gates**: Generated applications must pass all tests before deployment, with iterative refinement until quality standards are met.

**Runtime Validation**: Deployed applications are continuously monitored for health and performance to ensure ongoing reliability.
