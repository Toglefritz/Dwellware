# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Flutter Dashboard is the primary user interface for the Household Software Engineer system, providing a native macOS desktop application that enables non-technical users to create, manage, and launch custom household applications. The dashboard serves as a central hub with an intuitive grid-based layout, conversational interface for application requests, real-time development progress monitoring, and seamless application launching capabilities. The interface prioritizes simplicity and clarity while providing powerful functionality for managing multiple custom applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to see all my applications in an organized grid layout, so that I can quickly find and access the tools I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard opens THEN the system SHALL display a responsive grid of application tiles
2. WHEN applications exist THEN each tile SHALL show the application title, description, status, and last updated timestamp
3. WHEN an application is in development THEN the tile SHALL display a progress indicator with current development phase
4. WHEN an application has failed THEN the tile SHALL show an error indicator with option to view details
5. WHEN no applications exist THEN the dashboard SHALL display a welcome message with "Create Your First App" call-to-action
6. WHEN the window is resized THEN the grid SHALL automatically adjust tile layout to maintain optimal spacing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to request new applications through natural conversation, so that I can describe what I need without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Create New App" THEN the system SHALL open a conversational interface modal
2. WHEN a user types a description THEN the system SHALL provide real-time input validation and suggestions
3. WHEN the description is unclear THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions in a chat-like format
4. WHEN the user provides sufficient information THEN the system SHALL summarize the request and ask for confirmation
5. WHEN the user confirms the request THEN the system SHALL submit the specification to the backend and close the modal
6. IF the user cancels the request THEN the system SHALL discard the conversation and return to the main dashboard
7. WHEN a user submits a message THEN the system SHALL immediately show a generic loading indicator with processing message
8. WHEN application development begins THEN the loading indicator SHALL update to show specific progress information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to see real-time progress when my applications are being developed, so that I understand what's happening and when they'll be ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a development job starts THEN the application tile SHALL show a progress bar with percentage completion
2. WHEN development milestones are reached THEN the progress display SHALL update with current phase information (e.g., "Generating Code", "Running Tests", "Building Container")
3. WHEN build logs are available THEN users SHALL be able to click a details button to view development progress in a expandable panel
4. WHEN development completes successfully THEN the tile SHALL show a "Ready to Launch" status with success animation
5. WHEN development fails THEN the tile SHALL show error status with option to retry or modify the request
6. WHEN multiple applications are developing simultaneously THEN each SHALL show independent progress without interference

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to launch my applications directly from the dashboard, so that I can start using my tools immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a completed application tile THEN the system SHALL launch the application in the appropriate container
2. WHEN launching a web application THEN the system SHALL open it in an embedded WebView with proper navigation controls
3. WHEN launching a desktop application THEN the system SHALL open it in a separate native window
4. WHEN an application is already running THEN clicking the tile SHALL bring the existing window to the foreground
5. WHEN an application fails to launch THEN the system SHALL display an error message with troubleshooting suggestions
6. WHEN an application is running THEN the tile SHALL show a "Running" indicator with option to stop or restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to modify existing applications through conversation, so that I can improve my tools as my needs change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks an application tile THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with "Modify App" option
2. WHEN "Modify App" is selected THEN the system SHALL open the conversational interface with existing application context
3. WHEN describing modifications THEN the system SHALL show the current application features and highlight what will change
4. WHEN modifications conflict with existing functionality THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN the user confirms modifications THEN the system SHALL create a new development job while preserving the original application until completion
6. IF modifications fail THEN the system SHALL keep the original application unchanged and offer retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a household user, I want the dashboard to be responsive and performant, so that I can work efficiently without delays or frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL display the main interface within 2 seconds
2. WHEN switching between views THEN transitions SHALL be smooth with appropriate loading indicators
3. WHEN real-time updates arrive THEN the interface SHALL update without blocking user interactions
4. WHEN handling large numbers of applications THEN the grid SHALL use virtualization to maintain performance
5. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the dashboard SHALL show appropriate offline indicators and cached data
6. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the dashboard SHALL gracefully degrade non-essential animations and effects

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a household user, I want clear visual feedback for all my actions, so that I understand what the system is doing and feel confident in my interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN they SHALL provide visual feedback with hover states
2. WHEN clicking buttons or tiles THEN they SHALL show immediate visual acknowledgment
3. WHEN operations are processing THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states with progress indicators
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed with clear, non-technical language and suggested actions
5. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide positive feedback with subtle animations
6. WHEN the system is busy THEN it SHALL prevent duplicate actions while showing busy indicators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a household user, I want the dashboard to follow macOS design conventions, so that it feels familiar and integrates well with my desktop environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL use native macOS window controls and behaviors
2. WHEN displaying content THEN it SHALL follow macOS typography, spacing, and color guidelines
3. WHEN showing notifications THEN it SHALL integrate with macOS notification system
4. WHEN handling keyboard shortcuts THEN it SHALL follow standard macOS conventions (Cmd+N for new, Cmd+W for close, etc.)
5. WHEN the system appearance changes THEN the dashboard SHALL automatically adapt to light/dark mode preferences
6. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN the dashboard SHALL support VoiceOver and other assistive technologies

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to organize and search my applications, so that I can efficiently manage a growing collection of custom tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN searching THEN results SHALL be highlighted and filtered in real-time as I type
3. WHEN I want to organize apps THEN I SHALL be able to create custom categories or tags
