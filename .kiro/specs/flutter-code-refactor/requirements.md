# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to refactor the Flutter codebase to comply with the updated coding standards that require each Dart file to contain exactly one class or enum. The current codebase has one violation where `app.dart` contains both `HouseholdAIEngineerApp` and `_TemporaryHomePage` classes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the Flutter codebase, I want each Dart file to contain exactly one class or enum, so that the code follows consistent architectural patterns and is easier to maintain and navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the Flutter codebase THEN each `.dart` file SHALL contain exactly one class, enum, or mixin definition
2. WHEN a file contains multiple classes THEN the classes SHALL be separated into individual files with appropriate naming
3. WHEN separating classes THEN the file names SHALL follow snake_case convention and match the class name
4. WHEN refactoring files THEN all imports and exports SHALL be updated to maintain functionality
5. WHEN creating new files THEN each file SHALL include proper documentation following the project's documentation standards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the temporary home page to be properly separated from the main app widget, so that the code structure is clean and follows the established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the `app.dart` file THEN it SHALL contain only the `HouseholdAIEngineerApp` class
2. WHEN the `_TemporaryHomePage` class is extracted THEN it SHALL be placed in its own file with appropriate naming
3. WHEN creating the new file THEN it SHALL be located in the appropriate directory structure
4. WHEN updating imports THEN the `app.dart` file SHALL import the new temporary home page file
5. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the barrel file (models.dart) to be properly organized, so that imports are clean and follow the project's linting rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the `models.dart` barrel file THEN it SHALL include a proper library directive
2. WHEN the barrel file exports are listed THEN they SHALL be sorted alphabetically
3. WHEN the barrel file is updated THEN it SHALL pass all linting checks
4. WHEN using the barrel file THEN all model imports SHALL continue to work correctly
5. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the barrel file SHALL serve as the single import point for all models
