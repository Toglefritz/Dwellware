# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create screens directory structure
  - Create the `lib/screens/` directory if it doesn't exist
  - Establish proper directory structure for screen components
  - _Requirements: 2.3_

- [x] 2. Extract TemporaryHomePage class to separate file
  - Create `lib/screens/temporary_home_page.dart` file
  - Move `_TemporaryHomePage` class from `app.dart` to the new file
  - Rename class from `_TemporaryHomePage` to `TemporaryHomePage` (make it public)
  - Add comprehensive documentation following project standards
  - Add proper library directive and imports
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 1.3, 1.5_

- [ ] 3. Update app.dart to use extracted class
  - Remove `_TemporaryHomePage` class definition from `app.dart`
  - Add import statement for the new `temporary_home_page.dart` file
  - Update the home property to use `TemporaryHomePage()` instead of `_TemporaryHomePage()`
  - Verify that `app.dart` now contains only the `HouseholdAIEngineerApp` class
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4, 1.4_

- [ ] 4. Fix models barrel file linting issues
  - Add proper library directive to `lib/models/models.dart`
  - Sort all export statements alphabetically to comply with linting rules
  - Ensure the barrel file maintains its function as single import point
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Validate refactoring completeness
  - Run `flutter analyze` to ensure all linting rules pass
  - Compile the project to verify no import errors exist
  - Test application launch to confirm temporary home page displays correctly
  - Verify all model imports through barrel file continue to work
  - Confirm each Dart file contains exactly one class or enum
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.5, 3.3, 3.5_
