# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the refactoring approach to ensure the Flutter codebase follows the one-class-per-file architectural pattern. The refactoring focuses on separating the `_TemporaryHomePage` class from `app.dart` and addressing minor issues in the barrel file organization.

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis

The codebase analysis reveals:
- Most model files already follow the one-class-per-file pattern correctly
- One violation exists in `app.dart` with two classes: `HouseholdAIEngineerApp` and `_TemporaryHomePage`
- The `models.dart` barrel file needs minor improvements for linting compliance

### Target Architecture

The refactored architecture will maintain:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each file contains exactly one class/enum with focused responsibility
- **Clear File Organization**: File names match their contained class names using snake_case
- **Proper Documentation**: All files include comprehensive documentation following project standards
- **Import Management**: Clean import structure with proper barrel file usage

## Components and Interfaces

### File Structure Changes

#### Before Refactoring
```
lib/
├── app.dart (contains HouseholdAIEngineerApp + _TemporaryHomePage)
├── models/
│   ├── models.dart (barrel file with linting issues)
│   └── [other model files - already compliant]
```

#### After Refactoring
```
lib/
├── app.dart (contains only HouseholdAIEngineerApp)
├── screens/
│   └── temporary_home_page.dart (contains TemporaryHomePage)
├── models/
│   ├── models.dart (improved barrel file)
│   └── [other model files - unchanged]
```

### Class Extraction Strategy

#### TemporaryHomePage Class
- **Current Location**: `lib/app.dart` as `_TemporaryHomePage` (private)
- **New Location**: `lib/screens/temporary_home_page.dart` as `TemporaryHomePage` (public)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Screens belong in the `screens/` directory following project structure
  - Making it public allows for better testability and reusability
  - Follows the naming convention where file name matches class name

#### HouseholdAIEngineerApp Class
- **Location**: Remains in `lib/app.dart`
- **Changes**: Remove the embedded `_TemporaryHomePage` class and import the new file
- **Rationale**: The main app widget should remain in the root app.dart file

## Data Models

No data model changes are required as this is purely a structural refactoring. All existing model classes already follow the one-class-per-file pattern.

## Error Handling

### Refactoring Safety Measures

1. **Import Validation**: Ensure all imports are updated correctly to prevent compilation errors
2. **Functionality Preservation**: Verify that the app behavior remains identical after refactoring
3. **Documentation Consistency**: Maintain documentation quality across all modified files
4. **Linting Compliance**: Ensure all files pass the project's linting rules

### Risk Mitigation

- **Incremental Changes**: Make one file change at a time to isolate potential issues
- **Import Dependencies**: Carefully track and update all import statements
- **Testing**: Run the application after each change to verify functionality

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Approach

1. **Compilation Check**: Ensure the project compiles without errors after refactoring
2. **Runtime Verification**: Launch the application to verify the temporary home page displays correctly
3. **Import Testing**: Verify that all model imports through the barrel file continue to work
4. **Linting Validation**: Run `flutter analyze` to ensure all linting rules pass

### Test Cases

#### Functional Testing
- Application launches successfully
- Temporary home page displays with correct styling and content
- Theme switching works correctly
- All existing functionality remains intact

#### Code Quality Testing
- All files pass linting checks
- Documentation standards are maintained
- File naming conventions are followed
- Import statements are clean and functional

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Extract TemporaryHomePage
1. Create `lib/screens/temporary_home_page.dart`
2. Move and rename `_TemporaryHomePage` to `TemporaryHomePage`
3. Add proper documentation and library directive
4. Update imports in `app.dart`

### Phase 2: Clean Up Barrel File
1. Add library directive to `models.dart`
2. Sort export statements alphabetically
3. Verify all imports continue to work

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Run `flutter analyze` to check for linting issues
2. Test application functionality
3. Verify documentation completeness

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- No changes to existing model classes required
- Import updates in `app.dart` to reference new temporary home page location
- Potential updates to any files that might import the temporary home page (currently none)

### External Dependencies
- No external package changes required
- Flutter framework dependencies remain unchanged

## Performance Considerations

This refactoring has minimal performance impact:
- **Positive**: Slightly improved compilation times due to better file organization
- **Neutral**: No runtime performance changes expected
- **Build Impact**: Negligible impact on build times due to the small scope of changes

## Security Considerations

No security implications as this is purely a structural refactoring without changes to functionality or data handling.

## Maintenance Benefits

The refactoring provides several maintenance advantages:
- **Code Navigation**: Easier to locate specific classes using file names
- **Testing**: Individual classes can be tested in isolation more easily
- **Modification**: Changes to one class don't require opening files with multiple classes
- **Code Review**: Smaller, focused files are easier to review
- **IDE Support**: Better IDE navigation and search functionality
