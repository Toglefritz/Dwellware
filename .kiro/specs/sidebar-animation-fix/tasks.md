# Implementation Plan

- [-] 1. Convert DashboardSidebar to StatefulWidget with animation infrastructure
  - Convert `DashboardSidebar` from `StatelessWidget` to `StatefulWidget`
  - Add `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` for animation controller support
  - Implement `AnimationController` with 250ms duration matching current animation
  - Create width and content opacity animations with appropriate curves
  - Add proper disposal of animation controller in `dispose()` method
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement animation state management and timing logic
  - Create `SidebarAnimationState` enum to track animation phases
  - Add animation state tracking with proper state transitions
  - Implement content fade timing at 30% of animation progress
  - Add animation listeners to update state and trigger rebuilds
  - Create helper methods to determine when content should be visible
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1_

- [ ] 3. Update sidebar content visibility logic with opacity animations
  - Replace width-based `showExpandedContent` with animation-based visibility
  - Wrap text content in `AnimatedBuilder` widgets for opacity control
  - Implement smooth fade-in/fade-out for all text elements
  - Add `ClipRect` widgets to prevent text overflow during transitions
  - Ensure content appears/disappears at correct animation timing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 4. Update SidebarHeader component for animation compatibility
  - Modify `SidebarHeader` to accept animation progress parameter
  - Wrap title text in opacity animation based on animation state
  - Add overflow clipping to prevent title text wrapping
  - Maintain existing toggle button functionality and positioning
  - Ensure proper spacing and layout during all animation phases
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Update SidebarNavigationItem components for smooth transitions
  - Modify `_ExpandedNavigationContent` to use opacity animations
  - Add overflow prevention to navigation item labels
  - Ensure badges and counts animate smoothly without wrapping
  - Update collapsed/expanded state transitions to be animation-driven
  - Maintain existing hover effects and selection states
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 4.2, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Update SidebarCategoriesSection for animation compatibility
  - Wrap category section content in opacity animations
  - Add overflow clipping to category labels and counts
  - Ensure category items fade in/out smoothly during transitions
  - Maintain existing category filtering functionality
  - Update section title to animate with proper timing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive error handling and edge case management
  - Implement animation controller initialization error handling
  - Add fallback behavior for failed animations (immediate state change)
  - Handle rapid toggle scenarios without animation conflicts
  - Ensure proper cleanup when widget is disposed during animation
  - Add animation interruption handling for smooth state recovery
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Create unit tests for animation logic and state management
  - Write tests for animation controller initialization and disposal
  - Test animation state transitions and timing
  - Verify content visibility logic at different animation progress points
  - Test rapid toggle scenarios and edge cases
  - Create tests for error handling and fallback behavior
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 9. Create widget tests for complete animation integration
  - Test full expand/collapse animation cycles
  - Verify no text wrapping occurs during transitions using widget testing
  - Test animation behavior with different screen sizes
  - Create tests for accessibility during animations
  - Test performance and memory usage during repeated animations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 10. Add comprehensive documentation and code comments
  - Document all new animation-related classes and methods
  - Add inline comments explaining animation timing and logic
  - Update existing component documentation for animation changes
  - Create code examples for animation configuration
  - Document troubleshooting steps for animation issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
