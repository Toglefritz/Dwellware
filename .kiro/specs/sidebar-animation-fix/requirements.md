# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dashboard sidebar currently experiences undesirable text wrapping artifacts during its expand/collapse animation. When transitioning between expanded and collapsed states, text elements attempt to fit within the changing width, causing visual glitches where text wraps to multiple lines before disappearing or appearing. This creates a jarring user experience that detracts from the smooth, professional interface expected in a macOS-style application.

The solution needs to eliminate these text wrapping artifacts while maintaining the smooth animation transition and responsive behavior of the sidebar.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar animation to be smooth and professional without text wrapping artifacts, so that the interface feels polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar animates from expanded to collapsed THEN no text should wrap to multiple lines during the transition
2. WHEN the sidebar animates from collapsed to expanded THEN no text should appear with wrapping artifacts during the transition
3. WHEN the animation is in progress THEN text content should either be fully visible or completely hidden
4. WHEN the animation completes THEN all text should display correctly in the final state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar to maintain its current functionality and visual design, so that the fix doesn't break existing behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar is fully expanded THEN all navigation items, categories, and labels should display as they currently do
2. WHEN the sidebar is fully collapsed THEN only icons should be visible as they currently are
3. WHEN hovering over collapsed items THEN tooltips should still appear with full text
4. WHEN the animation duration and easing THEN they should remain the same as the current implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the solution to be maintainable and follow the project's coding standards, so that future modifications are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the fix THEN it should follow the established MVC pattern
2. WHEN adding new code THEN it should include comprehensive documentation per project standards
3. WHEN modifying existing components THEN the changes should be minimal and focused
4. WHEN the solution is complete THEN it should not introduce performance regressions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar animation to work consistently across all text elements, so that the entire interface behaves predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any text element in the sidebar animates THEN it should use the same wrapping prevention technique
2. WHEN navigation items animate THEN their labels should not wrap
3. WHEN category items animate THEN their labels should not wrap
4. WHEN the header title animates THEN it should not wrap
5. WHEN any badges or counts animate THEN they should remain properly positioned
