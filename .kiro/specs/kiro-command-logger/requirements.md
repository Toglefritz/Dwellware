# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a minimal VS Code extension that logs commands executed by Kiro to the debug console. The primary purpose is to understand how to interact with Kiro programmatically by observing the commands and arguments used during normal AI agent interactions. This extension serves as a research tool that will eventually enable external systems to interact with Kiro outside of the IDE window.

The extension will capture and log all VS Code commands executed during Kiro operations, providing insights into the command patterns, argument structures, and interaction flows that can be replicated programmatically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer researching Kiro's programmatic interface, I want to see all commands executed by Kiro in the debug console, so that I can understand the command patterns and arguments used during AI agent interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro executes any VS Code command THEN the extension SHALL log the command name and arguments to the debug console
2. WHEN a user interacts with Kiro's AI agent THEN all resulting VS Code commands SHALL be captured and displayed
3. WHEN the extension is active THEN it SHALL continuously monitor for command execution without user intervention
4. WHEN commands are logged THEN the output SHALL include both the command identifier and any arguments passed
5. WHEN multiple commands are executed in sequence THEN each command SHALL be logged separately with clear distinction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing Kiro's behavior, I want the logged commands to include timestamps and context information, so that I can correlate command execution with specific user actions and understand the timing of operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command is logged THEN the extension SHALL include a timestamp showing when the command was executed
2. WHEN commands are logged THEN the output SHALL be formatted in a readable structure with clear separation between different data elements
3. WHEN the debug console becomes cluttered THEN the extension SHALL provide clear, consistent formatting to distinguish Kiro command logs from other debug output
4. WHEN analyzing command patterns THEN the logged information SHALL be sufficient to understand the sequence and timing of operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer building external integrations with Kiro, I want to filter and focus on specific types of commands, so that I can identify the most relevant commands for programmatic interaction without being overwhelmed by noise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension logs commands THEN it SHALL provide a way to identify which commands are likely Kiro-related versus general VS Code operations
2. WHEN filtering command output THEN the extension SHALL allow focusing on commands that match specific patterns or prefixes
3. WHEN analyzing command logs THEN the extension SHALL provide clear indication of command categories or types
4. WHEN debugging specific interactions THEN the extension SHALL support identifying command sequences related to particular Kiro operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the command logging extension, I want a simple installation and activation process, so that I can quickly start monitoring Kiro commands without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the extension THEN it SHALL activate automatically without requiring manual configuration
2. WHEN the extension is active THEN it SHALL begin logging commands immediately upon VS Code startup
3. WHEN the extension encounters errors THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing or interfering with normal VS Code operation
4. WHEN the extension is disabled THEN it SHALL stop logging commands and clean up any resources without affecting VS Code performance
5. WHEN the extension is first installed THEN it SHALL provide clear indication in the debug console that command logging has started

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer researching Kiro's programmatic interface, I want the extension to capture comprehensive command data, so that I can replicate the same interactions programmatically in external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands include complex arguments THEN the extension SHALL log the complete argument structure including nested objects and arrays
2. WHEN commands return results THEN the extension SHALL attempt to capture and log return values where possible
3. WHEN commands fail or throw errors THEN the extension SHALL log the error information alongside the command details
4. WHEN commands are part of a larger operation THEN the extension SHALL provide context to help understand the relationship between sequential commands
5. WHEN analyzing logged data THEN the information SHALL be sufficient to understand how to programmatically invoke the same commands with the same arguments
