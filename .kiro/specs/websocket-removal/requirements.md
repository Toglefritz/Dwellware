# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the removal of the WebSocket communication layer from the kiro-communication-bridge extension. The WebSocket functionality adds complexity without providing significant value, as the frontend can monitor application development progress through file system changes or periodic polling of manifest JSON documents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the kiro-communication-bridge extension, I want the WebSocket server functionality removed so that the codebase is simpler and easier to test and troubleshoot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is loaded THEN no WebSocket server SHALL be started
2. WHEN the extension is activated THEN no WebSocket-related dependencies SHALL be initialized
3. WHEN the extension is deactivated THEN no WebSocket cleanup SHALL be required
4. WHEN examining the codebase THEN no WebSocket server implementation SHALL exist

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension API, I want all WebSocket-related API endpoints and documentation removed so that the API surface is clean and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the API documentation THEN no WebSocket integration sections SHALL be present
2. WHEN examining API endpoints THEN no WebSocket-related endpoints SHALL exist
3. WHEN reading the API documentation THEN no references to real-time updates via WebSocket SHALL be mentioned
4. WHEN using the REST API THEN no WebSocket events SHALL be emitted

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the extension, I want all WebSocket-related dependencies and imports removed so that the extension has minimal dependencies and faster startup time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining package.json THEN no WebSocket-related dependencies SHALL be listed
2. WHEN reviewing TypeScript imports THEN no WebSocket-related imports SHALL exist
3. WHEN building the extension THEN no WebSocket-related code SHALL be compiled
4. WHEN installing the extension THEN no WebSocket dependencies SHALL be downloaded

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the extension, I want all WebSocket-related configuration options removed so that the configuration is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining extension configuration THEN no WebSocket port settings SHALL exist
2. WHEN reviewing configuration interfaces THEN no WebSocket-related properties SHALL be defined
3. WHEN using default configuration THEN no WebSocket server SHALL be configured
4. WHEN validating configuration THEN no WebSocket-related validation SHALL occur

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer testing the extension, I want all WebSocket-related tests removed so that the test suite is focused and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN no WebSocket server tests SHALL execute
2. WHEN examining test files THEN no WebSocket-related test cases SHALL exist
3. WHEN reviewing test mocks THEN no WebSocket-related mocks SHALL be present
4. WHEN analyzing test coverage THEN no WebSocket code paths SHALL be covered

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user of the extension, I want the version number incremented and the extension properly packaged so that I can use the updated version without WebSocket functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining package.json THEN the version number SHALL be incremented
2. WHEN building the extension THEN compilation SHALL succeed without errors
3. WHEN packaging the extension THEN a new .vsix file SHALL be created
4. WHEN installing the extension THEN it SHALL activate successfully
5. WHEN using the extension THEN core functionality SHALL work without WebSocket dependencies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer reading the codebase, I want all references to real-time communication removed from comments and documentation so that the code accurately reflects the current architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading code comments THEN no references to WebSocket communication SHALL exist
2. WHEN examining JSDoc documentation THEN no WebSocket-related descriptions SHALL be present
3. WHEN reviewing README files THEN no WebSocket setup instructions SHALL exist
4. WHEN reading inline documentation THEN no real-time update promises SHALL be mentioned
