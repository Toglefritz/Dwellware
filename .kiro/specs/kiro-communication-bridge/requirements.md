# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Kiro Communication Bridge is a lightweight VS Code extension that provides a simple communication layer between the Flutter frontend dashboard and the Kiro IDE. This extension enables the frontend to send commands to Kiro and receive responses, creating a bridge for automated development workflows.

The extension focuses solely on message passing and command forwarding, without complex orchestration, job management, or workspace creation. It serves as a minimal interface that allows the Flutter app to interact with Kiro's existing command system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter frontend, I want to send commands to Kiro through a REST API, so that I can trigger Kiro operations remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension receives a POST request to `/api/kiro/execute` THEN it SHALL forward the command to Kiro IDE and return the result
2. WHEN the request contains a `command` field THEN the extension SHALL execute that command in Kiro's command palette
3. WHEN the request contains optional `args` field THEN the extension SHALL pass those arguments to the Kiro command
4. IF the command execution fails THEN the extension SHALL return an error response with the failure details
5. WHEN a command is successfully executed THEN the extension SHALL return the command output and status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Flutter frontend, I want to receive real-time updates from Kiro operations, so that I can display progress and status information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Kiro command is executed THEN the extension SHALL emit progress updates via WebSocket
2. WHEN Kiro outputs text or logs THEN the extension SHALL forward that output to connected WebSocket clients
3. WHEN a command completes THEN the extension SHALL emit a completion event with the final status
4. WHEN an error occurs during command execution THEN the extension SHALL emit an error event with details
5. WHEN the WebSocket connection is established THEN the extension SHALL confirm the connection is ready

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Flutter frontend, I want to query the current status of Kiro, so that I can determine if it's ready to accept commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension receives a GET request to `/api/kiro/status` THEN it SHALL return Kiro's current state
2. WHEN Kiro is idle THEN the extension SHALL return status "ready"
3. WHEN Kiro is executing a command THEN the extension SHALL return status "busy" with the current command
4. WHEN Kiro is not available THEN the extension SHALL return status "unavailable"
5. WHEN the status is requested THEN the extension SHALL include the Kiro version and available commands

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Flutter frontend, I want to send user input to ongoing Kiro operations, so that I can respond to interactive prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro requests user input THEN the extension SHALL emit a `user-input-required` event via WebSocket
2. WHEN the frontend sends input via POST to `/api/kiro/input` THEN the extension SHALL forward that input to Kiro
3. WHEN user input is provided THEN the extension SHALL resume the paused Kiro operation
4. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the extension SHALL return validation errors
5. WHEN input is successfully processed THEN the extension SHALL emit a `input-accepted` event

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the extension to handle connection errors gracefully, so that the communication bridge remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro becomes unresponsive THEN the extension SHALL detect the failure and update status to "unavailable"
2. WHEN WebSocket clients disconnect THEN the extension SHALL clean up the connection resources
3. WHEN API requests timeout THEN the extension SHALL return appropriate timeout errors
4. WHEN the extension starts THEN it SHALL verify Kiro is available and log the connection status
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the extension SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
