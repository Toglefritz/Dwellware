# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Kiro Command Research Tool that will systematically investigate and document Kiro IDE commands to enable remote orchestration of the Kiro IDE for the Dwellware project. The tool will discover command signatures, test their behavior, and create comprehensive documentation for integration purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer building the Dwellware orchestration layer, I want to understand the signature and behavior of each Kiro command, so that I can programmatically invoke them via a WebSocket bridge extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the research tool is activated THEN it SHALL scan all available Kiro commands from the VS Code command registry
2. WHEN a command is selected for research THEN the tool SHALL attempt to discover its parameter signature through VS Code API introspection
3. WHEN command introspection is performed THEN the tool SHALL document parameter types, required vs optional parameters, and return value types
4. IF a command signature cannot be automatically discovered THEN the tool SHALL provide a manual documentation interface
5. WHEN command documentation is complete THEN it SHALL be stored in a structured format (JSON/YAML) for programmatic access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with Kiro commands, I want to safely test command execution with different parameters, so that I can understand their actual behavior without breaking my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command is selected for testing THEN the tool SHALL provide a safe testing interface with parameter input fields
2. WHEN command parameters are provided THEN the tool SHALL validate parameter types before execution
3. WHEN a command is executed THEN the tool SHALL capture and display the command result, any side effects, and execution time
4. WHEN command execution fails THEN the tool SHALL capture and display error messages and stack traces
5. WHEN testing is complete THEN the tool SHALL save test results and examples for future reference
6. IF a command has destructive potential THEN the tool SHALL require explicit confirmation before execution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer building command sequences for application development workflows, I want to understand command dependencies and execution order, so that I can create reliable automation scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing workflow commands THEN the tool SHALL identify commands that must be executed in sequence
2. WHEN command dependencies are discovered THEN the tool SHALL document prerequisite commands and state requirements
3. WHEN testing command sequences THEN the tool SHALL validate that prerequisite conditions are met
4. WHEN workflow analysis is complete THEN the tool SHALL generate workflow templates for common development tasks
5. IF command execution order matters THEN the tool SHALL document timing requirements and state transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer creating the WebSocket bridge extension, I want comprehensive API documentation for each relevant command, so that I can implement reliable remote command execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN command research is complete THEN the tool SHALL generate API documentation in multiple formats (JSON, Markdown, TypeScript definitions)
2. WHEN documentation is generated THEN it SHALL include command descriptions, parameter schemas, return value schemas, and usage examples
3. WHEN API documentation is created THEN it SHALL categorize commands by functionality (agent interaction, file management, spec management, etc.)
4. WHEN documentation is exported THEN it SHALL include version information and compatibility notes
5. IF command behavior changes THEN the tool SHALL support documentation updates and change tracking

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the orchestration system, I want to monitor command usage patterns and performance, so that I can optimize the integration and identify potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands are executed through the research tool THEN it SHALL log execution metrics (timing, success rate, parameter patterns)
2. WHEN usage patterns are analyzed THEN the tool SHALL identify frequently used command combinations
3. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the tool SHALL highlight slow or unreliable commands
4. WHEN monitoring data is collected THEN it SHALL be exportable for analysis and reporting
5. IF command behavior is inconsistent THEN the tool SHALL flag commands that need special handling in the orchestration layer
