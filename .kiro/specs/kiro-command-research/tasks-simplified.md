# Simplified Implementation Plan

## Core Discovery and Documentation (Minimal Viable Product)

- [x] 1. Set up project structure and core interfaces
  - Create VS Code extension project structure with TypeScript configuration
  - Define simplified interfaces for CommandMetadata and DiscoveryResults
  - Set up JSON file storage utilities (no database required)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.4_

- [x] 2.1 Create command registry scanner
  - Write CommandRegistryScanner class to discover all VS Code commands
  - Implement filtering logic to identify Kiro-related commands
  - Create categorization system for kiroAgent vs kiro commands
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 2.2 Implement JSON-based storage
  - Create FileStorageManager class for JSON file operations
  - Implement save/load operations for discovery results
  - Add simple file-based caching and persistence
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.4_

- [ ] 3. Build documentation generation system
- [ ] 3.1 Create JSON export functionality
  - Implement JSON export of all discovered commands
  - Create structured output with categorization and statistics
  - Add timestamp and version tracking
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 3.2 Build Markdown documentation generator
  - Create Markdown documentation with command listings
  - Implement categorized sections and risk level indicators
  - Add summary statistics and discovery metadata
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 3.3 Generate TypeScript definitions
  - Create basic TypeScript interfaces for discovered commands
  - Generate type-safe command ID constants
  - Export command metadata types for integration
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 4. Create simple UI components
- [ ] 4.1 Build basic command explorer
  - Create tree view showing discovered commands by category
  - Display command metadata and risk levels
  - Add simple search and filtering
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 4.2 Add export functionality
  - Create export commands for JSON, Markdown, and TypeScript
  - Add file save dialogs and export location selection
  - Implement batch export of all formats
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.5_

## Removed Complex Features (Out of Scope)
- ~~Command testing framework~~ (too complex, safety concerns)
- ~~SQLite database~~ (dependency issues, overkill for research tool)
- ~~Workflow analysis~~ (advanced feature, not needed for basic research)
- ~~Performance monitoring~~ (not needed for discovery tool)
- ~~Advanced UI components~~ (keep it simple)
- ~~Command execution~~ (safety risk, not needed for research)
- ~~Parameter validation~~ (not testing commands, just documenting)
- ~~Side effect detection~~ (not executing commands)

## Success Criteria (Simplified)
1. **Discover all Kiro commands** from the command registry
2. **Categorize and analyze** commands by type and risk level
3. **Export results** in JSON, Markdown, and TypeScript formats
4. **Provide simple UI** for browsing discovered commands
5. **Work reliably** without complex dependencies or databases
