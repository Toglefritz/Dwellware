# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Project Architecture defines the directory structure, version control strategy, and application isolation mechanisms for the Household Software Engineer system. This architecture ensures complete independence between generated applications while providing robust version control, rollback capabilities, and clean user interfaces for managing application versions. The system maintains separate Git repositories for each application capsule and the frontend, enabling independent development cycles and risk-free experimentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a clear directory structure that separates system components from user applications, so that the system remains organized and maintainable as it scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL create a well-defined directory structure with separate areas for system components and user applications
2. WHEN new applications are created THEN they SHALL be stored in isolated capsule directories with no shared dependencies
3. WHEN system components are updated THEN user applications SHALL remain unaffected and continue to function independently
4. WHEN the directory structure is examined THEN it SHALL be immediately clear which components belong to the system versus user applications
5. IF directory corruption occurs THEN individual components SHALL be recoverable without affecting other parts of the system

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a household user, I want each of my applications to be completely independent, so that problems with one application never affect my other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application is created THEN it SHALL be stored in its own isolated capsule with complete source code, dependencies, and configuration
2. WHEN an application is modified THEN changes SHALL only affect that specific application and never impact other applications
3. WHEN an application fails or crashes THEN other applications SHALL continue running without interruption
4. WHEN an application is deleted THEN it SHALL be completely removed without leaving artifacts that could affect other applications
5. IF an application becomes corrupted THEN it SHALL be recoverable or removable without affecting the system or other applications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a household user, I want automatic version control for all my applications, so that I can safely experiment with changes knowing I can always go back to a working version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application is first created THEN the system SHALL initialize a Git repository for that application with an initial commit
2. WHEN application modifications are completed THEN the system SHALL automatically create a new commit with descriptive messages
3. WHEN significant milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL create tagged releases for easy identification and rollback
4. WHEN a user wants to see application history THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, non-technical interface showing version history
5. IF a user needs to rollback changes THEN the system SHALL provide simple options to revert to any previous version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a household user, I want to see and manage different versions of my applications through a simple interface, so that I can confidently make changes without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an application THEN the user SHALL see a simple version history with human-readable descriptions and timestamps
2. WHEN a new version is created THEN the user SHALL see clear indicators of what changed and why
3. WHEN selecting a previous version THEN the user SHALL be able to preview changes before deciding to rollback
4. WHEN rolling back to a previous version THEN the system SHALL handle all technical details transparently
5. IF rollback operations fail THEN the user SHALL receive clear explanations and alternative options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the frontend to have its own version control, so that frontend updates can be managed independently from user applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is initialized THEN it SHALL have its own Git repository separate from all application capsules
2. WHEN frontend updates are deployed THEN they SHALL not require changes to existing application capsules
3. WHEN frontend rollbacks are needed THEN they SHALL be possible without affecting any user applications
4. WHEN frontend versions are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing application interfaces
5. IF frontend updates introduce breaking changes THEN the system SHALL provide migration paths for affected applications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a development agent, I want Kiro to automatically manage version control operations, so that all code changes are properly tracked and tagged without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro completes application development THEN it SHALL automatically commit all changes with descriptive commit messages
2. WHEN Kiro creates a new application version THEN it SHALL create appropriate Git tags marking the release
3. WHEN Kiro makes incremental changes THEN it SHALL create logical commit boundaries that make sense for rollback purposes
4. WHEN Kiro encounters conflicts or issues THEN it SHALL handle version control operations gracefully and report status
5. IF Kiro operations fail THEN the version control system SHALL remain in a consistent state with clear error reporting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust backup and recovery mechanisms, so that all application data and version history can be preserved and restored if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applications are created or modified THEN all version control data SHALL be automatically backed up
2. WHEN system backups are performed THEN they SHALL include complete Git repositories for all applications and the frontend
3. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN individual applications SHALL be restorable from backups without affecting others
4. WHEN backup integrity is verified THEN the system SHALL ensure all version control history is complete and accessible
5. IF backup corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide recovery options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a household user, I want clear visual indicators of application status and version information, so that I can understand the current state of my applications without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing applications THEN each SHALL display clear version information with user-friendly labels
2. WHEN applications have pending changes THEN visual indicators SHALL show unsaved or uncommitted work
3. WHEN applications are being updated THEN progress indicators SHALL show version control operations in progress
4. WHEN version conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations and resolution options
5. IF version control issues arise THEN users SHALL receive actionable guidance for resolution

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want automated cleanup and maintenance of version control repositories, so that the system remains performant and storage-efficient over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repositories grow large THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize Git repositories to maintain performance
2. WHEN old versions are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL provide options to archive or compress historical data
3. WHEN storage space becomes limited THEN the system SHALL identify and suggest cleanup opportunities
4. WHEN maintenance operations run THEN they SHALL not interfere with active development or user operations
5. IF maintenance operations fail THEN the system SHALL preserve data integrity and provide recovery options
