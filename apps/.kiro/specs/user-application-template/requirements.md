# User Application - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec guides the creation of a single user application within the Household Software Engineer system. This application must be simple, narrowly-focused, and completable with minimal technical input from the user. The application is designed for household management and personal productivity, targeting users who may lack technical expertise.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Simplicity

**User Story:** As a non-technical user, I want this application to be simple and focused on a single purpose, so that I can use it effectively without confusion or technical barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating this application THEN it SHALL focus on one primary function or use case
2. WHEN designing the user interface THEN it SHALL use intuitive, familiar UI patterns
3. WHEN implementing features THEN it SHALL avoid complex workflows that require technical knowledge
4. IF multiple features are needed THEN it SHALL prioritize the core functionality over secondary features

### Requirement 2: Minimal User Input Requirement

**User Story:** As a busy household manager, I want this application to work with minimal setup and configuration, so that I can start using it immediately without extensive onboarding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN this application is first launched THEN it SHALL be usable with default settings
2. WHEN user input is required THEN it SHALL provide clear, simple prompts with examples
3. WHEN configuration is needed THEN it SHALL use sensible defaults and allow optional customization
4. IF data entry is required THEN it SHALL minimize the number of required fields

### Requirement 3: Manifest File Generation

**User Story:** As the frontend dashboard, I need metadata about this application, so that I can display accurate information and launch configurations to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN this application is created THEN it SHALL generate a manifest.json file in its directory
2. WHEN this application's status changes THEN it SHALL update the manifest file accordingly
3. WHEN this application is modified THEN it SHALL update the updatedAt timestamp in the manifest
4. IF this application has launch requirements THEN it SHALL specify the correct LaunchConfiguration in the manifest

### Requirement 4: Self-Contained Application Structure

**User Story:** As the system administrator, I want this application to be completely isolated, so that it doesn't interfere with other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating this application THEN it SHALL use its own dedicated directory with its own .kiro folder
2. WHEN implementing functionality THEN it SHALL avoid dependencies on other user applications
3. WHEN storing data THEN it SHALL use application-specific storage locations within its directory
4. IF external functionality is needed THEN it SHALL include necessary code within its own codebase

### Requirement 5: Web-Based Launch Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access this application through a web browser, so that I can use it from any device without additional software installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN this application is built THEN it SHALL be configured to run as a web application
2. WHEN this application starts THEN it SHALL be accessible via a unique localhost port
3. WHEN this application is launched THEN it SHALL use a port that doesn't conflict with other applications
4. IF this application requires external resources THEN it SHALL handle network connectivity gracefully

### Requirement 6: Rapid Development and Deployment

**User Story:** As a user requesting this application, I want it to be built quickly and reliably, so that I can start using it without long wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing this application THEN it SHALL use simple, proven technology stacks
2. WHEN creating the implementation plan THEN it SHALL avoid complex architectural patterns
3. WHEN building features THEN it SHALL prioritize working functionality over optimization
4. IF implementation becomes complex THEN it SHALL simplify the feature set to maintain rapid development

### Requirement 7: Progress Tracking and Status Updates

**User Story:** As a user waiting for this application, I want to see real-time progress updates, so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development begins THEN this application SHALL update its status to "building"
2. WHEN major milestones are reached THEN this application SHALL update the manifest with progress information
3. WHEN this application is complete THEN it SHALL update the status to "running"
4. IF errors occur during development THEN this application SHALL update the status to indicate the issue

### Requirement 8: Household-Focused Functionality

**User Story:** As a household manager, I want this application to solve real household problems, so that it provides genuine value for my daily life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing features THEN this application SHALL focus on common household management tasks
2. WHEN creating user interfaces THEN this application SHALL consider family-friendly usage patterns
3. WHEN implementing data models THEN this application SHALL reflect typical household structures and needs
4. IF business or enterprise features are needed THEN this application SHALL adapt them for household use
