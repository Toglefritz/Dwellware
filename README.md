# Dwellware

A personal AI-powered software development system that creates custom applications for your home on demand. Simply describe what you need in plain English, and watch as your personal software engineer designs, codes, tests, and deploys bespoke tools tailored to your unique needs.

## Overview

Dwellware transforms is a personal development environment where you can create custom applications without any technical knowledge. Through a conversational interface, you describe the tools you need, and the system handles everything from requirements gathering to deployment.

**Key Features:**
- üó£Ô∏è **Natural Language Interface** - Describe your needs in plain English
- üì± **Native macOS App** - Beautiful Flutter desktop interface
- üîí **Sandboxed Applications** - Each app runs independently and securely
- üîÑ **Iterative Development** - Refine and modify apps through conversation
- ‚ö° **Real-time Progress** - Watch your applications being built live

## System Architecture

The system consists of four main components working together:

### 1. Flutter Desktop Dashboard
Your main interface for managing applications:

- Grid view of all your custom applications
- Conversational interface for requesting new apps
- Real-time development progress monitoring
- One-click application launching

### 2. Orchestrator Backend
The intelligent coordination layer that:

- Processes natural language requests into technical specifications
- Manages Amazon Kiro development sessions
- Handles application deployment and containerization
- Provides real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- Maintains application metadata and version control

### 3. AI Development Engine (Amazon Kiro)
Automated development capabilities:

- Generates code, tests, and documentation from specifications
- Iteratively refines implementations until quality standards are met
- Follows predefined templates and coding policies
- Outputs complete application artifacts

### 4. Application Isolation System
Ensures security and stability:

- Each application runs independently
- Isolated file system and network access per application
- Changes to the codebase for one application do not affect any of the other applications

## Example Use Cases
