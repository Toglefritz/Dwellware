# Household Software Engineer – Frontend

This repository contains the **frontend dashboard** for the Household Software Engineer system.  
It is a Flutter desktop application that serves as the main user interface for creating and managing
custom household applications.

## Overview

The frontend provides a beautiful, user-friendly desktop interface where you can request, monitor,
and launch bespoke applications generated by the Household Software Engineer system.  
Through a conversational interface, you describe the tools you need, and the system handles
everything else.

## Key Features

- 🖥️ **Flutter Desktop Dashboard** – Cross-platform UI built with Flutter
- 🗂️ **Application Grid View** – Manage all your custom applications in one place
- 💬 **Conversational Requests** – Describe new applications in plain English
- ⚡ **Real-Time Progress** – Watch live updates as your apps are being built
- 🚀 **One-Click Launch** – Start applications directly from the dashboard

## Architecture Role

This frontend is **one of four core components** of the Household Software Engineer system:

1. **Flutter Desktop Dashboard (this project)** – Your main interface for managing and launching
   apps
2. **Orchestrator Backend** – Translates requests into specifications, manages builds, and
   deployment
3. **AI Development Engine (Amazon Kiro)** – Generates, tests, and refines code automatically
4. **Application Isolation System** – Runs each app securely in its own container

The frontend communicates with the Orchestrator Backend via WebSocket and REST APIs to display
real-time build status, app metadata, and deployment information.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Flutter
   installed: [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/household_ai_engineer_frontend.git
   cd household_ai_engineer_frontend
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d macos
   ```
   (Other desktop targets may be supported depending on your environment)

## Development Notes

- Built with **Flutter 3.x**
- Designed primarily for **macOS desktop**, but Flutter supports Linux/Windows as well
- Uses **WebView embedding** for web apps and **native windows** for desktop binaries
- Communicates with the backend via **WebSocket** for progress updates and **REST APIs** for
  metadata
